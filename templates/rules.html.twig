            <p class="rules">Each player takes a turn by hitting the roll button to roll the die.</p>
            <p class="rules">Each player uses a note pad to write down their final score for each round.</p>
            <p class="rules">At any point before the next roll, any player can bank the current score by writing it down. Let other players know that you are banking it.</p>
            <p class="rules">Only players who have not banked a score continue to roll.</p>
            <p class="rules">If a 1 is rolled, the round is over and any player who has not banked a score will have a 0 for that round.</p>
            <p class="rules">At the end of the game, each player adds their scores for each round to get a final score.</p>
            <p class="rules">The best way to play is to agree on a prize for the winner and a concequence for the looser before the game starts.</p>
